### Week Five Response
****
This week I did not get as much time as I would have liked to really mess around with all the new animation like functions but I did manage to create what I had envisioned for my animation so I am quite pleased with that. One problem I did have, which was a simple mistake was putting these things '' around my r,g,b variable for my background. it was recognizing it as a color in r,g,b and giving me white instead of random colors like I had wanted. After many hours of trouble shooting and googling, I figured out my silly mistake. I think my paint program animation is a lot of fun and I am really excited to create even cooler things continuing in this course
