### Week 11 Response

----

Last assignment I used a two dimensional Array and created rectangular objects from a class I defined in a large grid pattern.

This assignment I modified my code from the last assignment to be object oriented and more efficient.  I created "classes" for the color cells and for the two dimensional array. I then created a large number of objects from the classes. I then wrote functions to randomize the cell colors without creating new objects. I basically created a huge number of objects and then modified them with functions.  If you compare my code from last week, this new approach uses less objects and thus less memory.

I enjoyed using the prototype keyword to create new functions for my classes. Seems like a better way to write code.
