### Week Four Response

****

This week I spent a little time playing with all of the new functions I learned in the course. I will still have to mess around wih it more to really understand and properly utiliaze these functions but I beleive I am off to a good start.
The course material whet over a lot information and I defintely will be going over it more in order to get everthing down. Applying it in actual practice again and again will definitely help sullidifly the functions and how they work in my memory.
I did not have too much trouble while creating my little monster friend this week. The web control  window in firefox defintley came in handy when I couldn't see what was wrong. sometimes it was as simple as me misspelling a word. I did not get the chance to help any of my fellow classmates this cycle.
