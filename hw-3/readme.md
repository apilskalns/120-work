## Week Three Response

 During this homework cyle I went through all the the course materials on the website. As well as check the issues section on github to see if there was anything that would help me
 or I would be able to help with.
I completed the instruction given and
followed along with videos provided
to familiarize with the funtions and the tips given.I did not have any problems will completeing the homework this week thankfully. I don't know if there is anything in particular that I want to discuss further. It all seemed very straight forword. Though, I would like to learn more about HTML and how it works but I know this course won't be going into detail about it. I didn't have the chance to help any of my fellow classmates this cycle
